<p>Note that the calculation of <span class="math inline">\(X_S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_S\)</span> with matrix algebra is the same as it was with an equally weighted sum except that instead of post-multiplying by a vector of ones <span class="math inline">\((\boldsymbol{x^\prime 1})\)</span>, we post-multiply by a vector of weights <span class="math inline">\((\boldsymbol{x^\prime w}).\)</span> In truth, an equally weighted sum is a special case of a weighted sum in which <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{w}\)</span> consists entirely of ones.</p>
