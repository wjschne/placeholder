# Notation {-}

## Random variables, vectors, and matrices {-}

* Random variables are capital letters such as $X$ and $Y$.
* A particular value of $X$ is $x$.
* Vectors are bold lowercase symbols (e.g., $\boldsymbol{a}$,  $\boldsymbol{\theta}$).
* Matrices are bold uppercase symbols (e.g., $\boldsymbol{A}$, $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$).

Unfortunately, if vectors are lowercase and random variables are uppercase, my notation comes in conflict when discussing a vector of random variables (i.e., the variables as theoretical entities, not their particular scores). Such a vector will be a bold uppercase letter, (e.g., $\boldsymbol{X}$). A vector of particular scores from the variables in $\boldsymbol{X}$ will be shown as $\boldsymbol{x}$.

Expression | Meaning
:----------|:--------------------------------------
$\boldsymbol{A'}$ | The transpose of matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$
$\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}$ | The inverse of matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$
$\mathtt{diag}(\boldsymbol{A})$ | The vector formed from the diagonal of matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$
$\mathtt{diag}(\boldsymbol{a})$ | The diagonal matrix formed from vector $\boldsymbol{a}$
$\boldsymbol{1}_k$ | A column vector of $k$ ones. If $k$ is absent, the length of $\boldsymbol{1}$ can be inferred by context.
$\boldsymbol{I}_k$ | A $k \times k$ identity matrix. If $k$ is absent, the dimensions of $\boldsymbol{I}$ can be inferred by context.

## Sets and intervals {-}

A *set* is a collection of distinct objects. 

Expression | Meaning
:----------|:--------------------------------------
$\{a,b\}$ | A set consisting of two numbers, $a$ and $b$
$\lbrack a,b\rbrack$ | The set of real numbers in the interval between $a$ and $b$, inclusive
$(a,b)$ | The set of real numbers in the interval between $a$ and $b$, exclusive
$(a,b\rbrack$ | The set of real numbers in the interval between $a$ and $b$, excluding $a$ but including $b$
$\mathbb{R}$ | The set of all real numbers $[-\infty,\infty]$
$\mathbb{Z}$ | The set of all integers $\{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\}$
$\mathbb{N}_0$ | The set of all non-negative integers: $\{ 0,1,2,...\}$
$\mathbb{N}_1$ | The set of all positive integers: $\{ 1,2,3,...\}$
$\in$ | Is a member of (i.e., $X \in (a,b)$ means that $X$ is a member of the set of numbers between $a$ and $b$)

## Summation {-}

There are several ways to show that a variable is to be summed. The summation sign looks like a really big &Sigma;, the capital Greek letter sigma. If $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a vector with $k$ elements, the sum of all $k$ in $\boldsymbol{x}$ is:

$$\sum_{i = 1}^k x_i$$

With matrix algebra,


$$\sum_{i = 1}^k x_i=\boldsymbol{1}'\boldsymbol{x}$$


## Statistics

Expression | Meaning
:----------|:--------------------------------------
$\mu_X, m_X$ | The population and sample mean of $X$
$\sigma_X, s_X$ | The population and sample standard deviation of $X$
$\sigma_X^2, s_X^2$ | The population and sample variance of $X$
$\gamma_1, g_1$ | The population and sample skewness
$\gamma_2, g_2$ | The population and sample kurtosis

## Other {-}

Expression | Meaning
:----------|:--------------------------------------
$\binom{n}{k}$ | The \emph{binomial coefficient}. It is just a shortcut notation for $\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!\left(n-k\right)!}$. Read aloud, $\binom{n}{k}$ is ``$n$ choose $k$'' or the number of combinations that $n$ things have when taken $k$ at a time.
$f_X(x;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ | The probability density function or probability mass function of $X$ with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
$F_X(x;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ | The cumulative distribution function of $X$ with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$
$E(X)$ | The expected value of $X$
